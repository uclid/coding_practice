1. This repository is to document my coding practice done across multiple coding and interview preparation websites.
2. The code has been organized based on different programming languages I have used to solve those problems.
3. The questions will be presented as text-based comments before the start of each solution in a brief format. No details since I do not own these questions.
4. The focus is hence on the solutions for my personal reference. Note that they may not be the most efficient solutions.
